        <p>This air fryer meatloaf recipe is easy to make with just a few ingredients. </p>
        <h2>Air Fryer Meatloaf Ingredients</h2>
        <ul> 
            <li>Beef: This air fryer meatloaf recipe starts with a pound of lean ground beef. </li>
            <li>Vegetables: You'll need an onion for the loaf and mushrooms to press into the top. </li>
            <li>Egg: An egg lends moisture and helps bind the meat mixture together. </li>
            <li>Dry bread crumbs: Use store-bought bread crumbs or make your own at home. </li>
            <li>Seasonings: Season the meatloaf with fresh thyme, salt, and pepper. </li>
            <li>Oil: Coat the top of the meat loaf with olive oil before cooking in the air fryer. </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat an air fryer to 392 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Combine ground beef, onion, bread crumbs, thyme, egg, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Knead and mix thoroughly. Transfer mixture to a small loaf pan. Smooth the top, press in mushrooms, and coat with olive oil.</li>
            <li>Roast meatloaf in the preheated air fryer until nicely browned, about 25 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (72 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Let meatloaf rest at least 10 minutes before slicing into wedges and serving.</li>
        </ol>
